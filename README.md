# factorial_experiment_analysis
Python code to analyse factorial experiments.


## Current Features
- 2, 3 and 4 factor ANOVA tables can be produced, including all interactions.
- Some simple graphs can be plotted giving an overview of the data

## Current limitations
- Must have repeat data for each measurement
- No model/regression stuff yet

## Planned edits
- Complete rework, replacing many of the repeated lines of code with functions. This should allow for more complicated factorial experiments
